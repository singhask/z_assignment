Based on my experience as a Data Engineer, I have extensively worked with a range of tools and technologies that align closely with the requirements of designing and implementing 
ETL pipelines for multi-source data ingestion. 

I successfully migrated data warehouses from Snowflake to Redshift and transitioned multiple connectors from Fivetran to Airbyte, ensuring seamless integration of diverse data sources.
I automated workflows using Docker scripts and ECS with CI/CD pipelines and designed CDC pipelines using Debezium for Kafka-based ingestion. Leveraging Apache Spark, I implemented 
both streaming and batch processing scripts for generating actionable business insights from data stored in S3.

In previous roles, I have utilized Kubernetes to manage microservices for real-time ingestion pipelines, optimizing scalability and fault tolerance. My expertise with Apache Airflow 
enabled the creation of robust ETL workflows for data transformation and validation pipelines. I also built ETL solutions using Databricks notebooks, S3, and FastAPI to ensure 
efficient data processing tailored to client needs.

Security and compliance have been integral to my work, ensuring encrypted data transfer and access control across platforms like AWS, Azure, and Oracle. 
Through these projects, I have honed skills in performance optimization, error handling, and collaborative documentation to build scalable and reliable data engineering solutions.



Section 1: Data Source Understanding 

1. Differences between Facebook Ads, Google Ads, RDS, and CleverTap  
   - Data Structure:  
     - Facebook Ads and Google Ads APIs return hierarchical data, typically in JSON. This data includes campaign-level metrics like impressions, clicks, and spend. These are not always normalized, so they might require additional processing.  
     - RDS (Relational Database Service) organizes data in structured tables, using a predefined schema. Data here is well-structured and can be queried efficiently with SQL.  
     - CleverTap provides user-centric event-based data in JSON format, detailing user activities like app events, notifications, and demographics.  
   - API Access:  
     - Facebook Ads uses the Graph API, which requires a user access token and permissions configured for specific data levels.  
     - Google Ads API requires OAuth for authentication, and its endpoints allow granular control, such as querying campaign performance or ad group data.  
     - RDS doesn't have an API but is accessed using standard database drivers like JDBC/ODBC for SQL-based querying.  
     - CleverTap's REST API provides access via an authentication key specific to the application.  
   - Data Types:  
     - Facebook Ads and Google Ads provide numeric metrics (CTR, impressions), date/time, and categorical data (e.g., campaign names).  
     - RDS supports a variety of SQL data types like INT, VARCHAR, and DATETIME, depending on the schema.  
     - CleverTap focuses on event metadata such as event type, timestamp, and associated user properties.


Section 2: ETL Pipeline Design  
2. High-Level ETL Pipeline Architecture  
   My approach to designing an ETL pipeline starts with understanding the business requirements and scalability needs. Here's how I'd architect a pipeline for this case:  
   - Extraction:  
     - Use API clients or SDKs to extract data from Facebook Ads and Google Ads. I’d configure the process to run daily during non-peak hours to minimize API rate-limit issues.  
   - Transformation:  
     - Clean and normalize the data, ensuring consistent metric definitions (e.g., calculate CTR uniformly).  
     - Map the data into a schema compatible with the RDS database, such as converting nested JSON into tabular format.  
   - Load:  
     - Insert data into staging tables in RDS. Once validated, move the data to final tables to ensure atomicity and consistency.  
   - Error Handling:  
     - Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for API calls. If an error persists, log it in an error tracking system for further investigation.  
   - Scalability:  
     - Partition large datasets by time periods (e.g., daily) to process them in chunks.  

Section 3: Apache Airflow  
3. Apache Airflow  
   Apache Airflow is a fantastic tool I’ve used extensively for orchestrating ETL workflows. It allows you to define tasks as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), where dependencies are explicitly defined.  
   - It provides scheduling capabilities, retry mechanisms, and monitoring through its UI, which makes managing complex workflows much easier.  
   - I have worked extensively on airflow dags for a Pharma client during migration pipeline. Have used multiple operators. Mostly while working for Knowldege Lens and Findability Sciences.
   Example Airflow DAG:  
   ```python
   from airflow import DAG
   from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator
   from datetime import datetime

   def extract_facebook_ads():
       print("Extracting data from Facebook Ads API...")

   def transform_data():
       print("Transforming data...")

   def load_to_rds():
       print("Loading data to RDS...")

   with DAG(
       dag_id="facebook_google_ads_etl",
       schedule_interval="0 3 * * *",
       start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
       catchup=False,
   ) as dag:
       extract = PythonOperator(task_id="extract", python_callable=extract_facebook_ads)
       transform = PythonOperator(task_id="transform", python_callable=transform_data)
       load = PythonOperator(task_id="load", python_callable=load_to_rds)

       extract >> transform >> load
   ```
   This simple DAG ensures tasks run in the correct order, with logging for traceability.

Section 4: Kubernetes Integration  
4. Role of Kubernetes  
   Kubernetes plays a vital role when deploying ETL pipelines, especially in a distributed environment. Here’s why:  
   - Scalability: Kubernetes automatically scales up or down based on the resource needs of the ETL jobs, ensuring the pipeline handles peak loads efficiently.  
   - Fault Tolerance: By monitoring pods, Kubernetes restarts any failed ETL task containers automatically.  
   - Resource Optimization: It schedules jobs on nodes with available capacity, ensuring cost-effective resource utilization.  

   - Have worked on monitoring pipeline run. We use to have a product and multiple services were regularly mpnitored using etl migration on backend services. (Kafka based pipelines)


Section 5: Data Transformation  
5. Python Function to Transform JSON Data  
   Here’s a function I wrote recently to convert Facebook Ads JSON data into a structured format suitable for loading into AWS Redshift:  
   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   def transform_facebook_data(json_data):
       # Example JSON structure: [{"ad_id": 1, "impressions": 100, "clicks": 5}]
       df = pd.DataFrame(json_data)
       df['ctr'] = df['clicks'] / df['impressions']  # Calculate Click-Through Rate (CTR)
       df['load_date'] = pd.Timestamp.now()  # Add a load timestamp
       return df
   ```


Section 6: Error Handling and Monitoring  
6. Strategies for Error Handling and Monitoring  
   - Error Handling: Implement API retry logic for transient errors. Validate data for completeness and correctness before transformation.  
   - Monitoring: I’d integrate with monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana for visual dashboards and set up alerting systems (e.g., Slack, PagerDuty) to notify about failures in real time.

Section 7: Security and Compliance  
7. Ensuring Data Security  
   - Encrypt all data in transit using HTTPS and at rest using tools like AWS KMS for database encryption.  
   - Implement least privilege access controls using IAM roles.  
   - Conduct regular audits to ensure compliance with GDPR or CCPA.  

Section 8: Performance Optimization  
8. Optimizing ETL Pipelines  
   - Use incremental extraction to process only new or updated data.  
   - Perform heavy transformations on distributed systems like Spark for large datasets.  
   - Leverage RDS indexing to improve query performance.

Section 9: Documentation and Collaboration  
9. Importance of Documentation  
   - Comprehensive documentation ensures smooth collaboration.  
   - Include details on API configurations, data flow, schema mapping, and common error resolutions.  

Section 10: Real-world Scenario  
10. Handling API Changes  
   - Start by reviewing the updated API documentation.  
   - Modify the data extraction logic to align with the new response structure.  
   - Test the pipeline extensively in staging before rolling out changes to production.
